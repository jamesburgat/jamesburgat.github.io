    <h1 border-block: 5px solid red;>My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?
    </h1>
    <blockquote>For TCI x Are.na's Library of Practical and Conceptual Resources, Laurel Schwulst encourages all artists
      to create and cultivate websites.</blockquote>
    <h3 id="what-is-a-website?">What is a website?</h3>
    <p style="color: crimson;">For the past handful of years, I’ve been teaching courses about interactive design and the
      internet.</p>
    <p style="color: chocolate;">I teach within art departments at universities, so we learn about the internet’s impact
      on art—and vice versa—and how technological advance often coincides with artistic development.</p>
    <p style="color: orange;">In class, we make websites. To do this, we learn the elemental markup and code languages of
      the web—HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.</p>
    <p style="color: goldenrod;">However, sometimes after the semester is over, I receive perplexing emails from students
      asking, “So how do I actually make a website?”</p>
    <p style="color: gold;">This sparked my own questioning. “What is a website, anyway?” It’s easy to forget. Today there
      are millions of ways to make a website, and the abundance is daunting. But at its core, a website is still the same
      as ever before:</p>
    <p>A website is a file or bundle of files living on a server somewhere. A server is a computer that’s always connected
      to the internet, so that when someone types your URL in, the server will offer up your website. Usually you have to
      pay for a server. You also have to pay for a domain name, which is an understandable piece of language that points
      to an IP. An IP is a string of numbers that is an address to your server.</p>
    <p>Links (rendered default blue and underlined—they’re the hypertext “HT” in HTML) are the oxygen of the web. Not all
      websites have links, but all links connect to other webpages, within the same site or elsewhere.</p>
    <p> But my students already know this! So when they ask me about actually making a website, they are referring to a
      website in the world … today.</p>
    <p>It’s healthy to acknowledge today’s web is much different than the web many of us grew up using. So when they ask
      how to make a website (despite having already “learned”), they are alluding to the technological friction and social
      pressures that often come along with creating and maintaining a website in 2018.</p>
    <p>Although they may seem initially accommodating and convenient to their users, universally popular social media
      sites—like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Pinterest—are private companies that prioritize advertising above
      their users’ needs. Their users’ happiness is not the primary focus, so it’s perfectly normal for you to feel
      anxiety when using or even thinking about social media. In this age of digital cacophony dominated by these
      platforms, no one is looking out for you… but you. It makes perfect sense, then, when individuals tell me they want
      their website to do the job of “setting the record straight” on who they are and what they do.</p>
    <p>However, clarity is one of many possible intentions for a website. There are other legitimate states of mind
      capable of communication—a surprising, memorable, monumental, soothing, shocking, unpredictable, radically boring,
      bizarre, mind-blowing, very quiet and subtle, and/or amazing website could work. You also need not limit yourself to
      only one website—as perhaps you’d like to confuse or surprise with multiple.</p>
    <p>My favorite aspect of websites is their duality: they’re both subject and object at once. In other words, a website
      creator becomes both author and architect simultaneously. There are endless possibilities as to what a website could
      be. What kind of room is a website? Or is a website more like a house? A boat? A cloud? A garden? A puddle? Whatever
      it is, there’s potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website
      helps form your own identity.</p>
    <h3 id="why-have-a-website?">Why have a website?</h3>
    <p class="baby-boy">Today more than ever, we need individuals rather than corporations to guide the web’s future. The
      web is called the web because its vitality depends on just that—an interconnected web of individual nodes breathing
      life into a vast network. This web needs to actually work for people instead of being powered by a small handful of
      big corporations—like Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, and Google.</p>
    <p class="baby-boy">Individuals can steer the web back to its original architecture simply by having a website. I
      think artists, in particular, could be instrumental in this space—showing the world where the web can go.</p>
    <p class="baby-boy">Artists excel at creating worlds. They do this first for themselves and then, when they share
      their work, for others. Of course, world-building means creating everything—not only making things inside the world
      but also the surrounding world itself—the language, style, rules, and architecture.</p>
    <p class="baby-boy">This is why websites are so important. They allow the author to create not only works (the
      “objects”) but also the world (the rooms, the arrangement of rooms, the architecture!). Ideally, the two would
      inform each other in a virtuous, self-perfecting loop. This can be incredibly nurturing to an artist’s practice.</p>
    <p class="baby-boy">To those creative people who say “I don’t need a website,” I ask: why not have a personal website
      that works strategically, in parallel to your other activities? How could a website complement what you already do
      rather than competing or repeating? How can you make it fun or thought-provoking or (insert desired feeling here)
      for you? How can the process of making and cultivating a website contribute to your approach?</p>
    <p class="baby-boy">A website can be anything. It doesn’t (and probably shouldn’t) be an archive of your complete
      works. That’s going to be dead the moment you publish. A website, or anything interactive, is inherently unfinished.
      It’s imperfect—maybe sometimes it even has a few bugs. But that’s the beauty of it. Websites are living, temporal
      spaces. What happens to websites after death, anyway?</p>
    <h3 id="what-can-a-website-be?">What can a website be?</h3>
    <b id="website-as-room">Website as room</b>
    <p>In an age of information overload, a room is comforting because it’s finite, often with a specific intended
      purpose.</p>
    <img src="images/image1.jpg">
    <h5>Louis Rossetto</h5>
    <p></p>
    <p>Simultaneously, a room can be flexible: you can shift its contents or even include a temporary partition, depending
      on occasion. You can also position elements in spatial juxtaposition, or create entrances to adjacent rooms through
      links.</p>
    <p>In the early days of The Creative Independent, we sometimes thought of TCI’s website like a house next to a river.
      We considered the interviews the flowing water, as they were our house’s nutrients and source of life. We would
      collect and drink from the water every day. But sometimes, depending on its nutrient makeup, the water would change
      our house. We’d wake up to see a new door where a picture frame once was. Knowledge became the architect.</p>
    <p>Like any metaphor, it’s not perfect. For better or worse, it’s much more difficult to delete a building than a
      website.</p>

    <b id="website-as-shelf">Website as shelf</b>
    <p></p>
    <p>Zooming into this room inside this house, we see a shelf. Maybe a shelf is easier to think about than a whole room.
      What does one put on a shelf? Books and objects from life? Sure, go ahead. Thankfully there’s nothing too heavy on
      the shelf, or else it would break. A few small things will do, knowledge-containing or not. Plus, lighter things are
      easy to change out. Is a book or trinket “so last year?” Move it off the shelf! Consider what surprising
      juxtapositions you can make on your little shelf.</p>
    <p></p>
    <b id="website-as-plant">Website as plant</b>
    <p></p>
    <p>Plants can’t be rushed. They grow on their own. Your website can be the same way, as long as you pick the right
      soil, water it (but not too much), and provide adequate sunlight. Plant an idea seed one day and let it gradually
      grow.</p>
    <p>Maybe it will flower after a couple of years. Maybe the next year it’ll bear fruit, if you’re lucky. Fruit could be
      friends or admiration or money—success comes in many forms. But don’t get too excited or set goals: that’s not the
      idea here. Like I said, plants can’t be rushed.</p>

    <b id="website-as-garden">Website as garden</b>
    <p></p>
    <p>Fred Rogers said you can grow ideas in the garden of your mind. Sometimes, once they’re little seedlings and can
      stand on their own, it helps to plant them outside, in a garden, next to the others.</p>
    <p>Gardens have their own ways each season. In the winter, not much might happen, and that’s perfectly fine. You might
      spend the less active months journaling in your notebook: less output, more stirring around on input. You need both.
      Plants remind us that life is about balance.</p>
    <p>It’s nice to be outside working on your garden, just like it’s nice to quietly sit with your ideas and place them
      onto separate pages.</p>

    <p></p>
    <b id="website-as-puddle">Website as puddle</b>
    <p></p>
    <p>A website could also be a puddle. A puddle is a temporary collection of rainwater. They usually appear after
      rainstorms. Like a storm, creating a website can happen in a burst. Sometimes it’s nice to have a few bursts/storms
      of creating a website, since the zone can be so elusive. Some people even call rain “computer weather.”</p>
    <p>There is also no state of “completeness” to a website, like a puddle, since they’re ephemeral by nature. Sometimes
      they can be very big and reflective. Despite their temporal nature, I’ve even seen some creatures thrive in puddles.
      Meanwhile, some smaller puddles may only last a day.</p>
    <p>Not everything, even the most beautiful puddle with its incredible reflective surface, needs to last long. If the
      world doesn’t end tomorrow, there will be another storm. And where there’s a hole, a puddle will appear again.</p>
    <p>Puddles evaporate slowly over time. It might be difficult, but I would love to see a website evaporate slowly, too.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <b>Website as thrown rock that’s now falling deep into the ocean</b>
    <p></p>
    <p>Sometimes you don’t want a website that you’ll have to maintain. You have other things to do. Why not consider your
      website a beautiful rock with a unique shape which you spent hours finding, only to throw it into the water until it
      hits the ocean floor? You will never know when it hits the floor, and you won’t care.</p>
    <p>Thankfully, rocks are plentiful and you can do this over and over again, if you like. You can throw as many
      websites as you want into the ocean. When an idea comes, find a rock and throw it.</p>

    <h3 id="The-web-is-what-we-make-it">The web is what we make it</h3>
    <p>While an individual website could be any of those metaphors I mentioned above, I believe the common prevailing
      metaphor—the internet as cloud—is problematic. The internet is not one all-encompassing, mysterious, and untouchable
      thing. (In early patent drawings depicting the internet, it appears as related shapes: a blob, brain, or explosion.)
      These metaphors obfuscate the reality that the internet is made up of individual nodes: individual computers talking
      to other individual computers.</p>
