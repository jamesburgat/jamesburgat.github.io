    <h3>The Order of Things</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>In The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences Foucault wrote that a historical period is characterized by epistemes — ways of thinking about truth and about discourse — which are common to the fields of knowledge, and determine what ideas it is possible to conceptualize and what ideas it is acceptable to affirm as true. That the acceptable ideas change and develop in the course of time, manifested as paradigm shifts of intellectualism, for instance between the "Classical Age"[1] and "Modernity" (from Kant onwards) — which is the period considered by Foucault in the book — is support for the thesis that every historical period has underlying epistemic assumptions, ways of thinking that determined what is truth and what is rationally acceptable.</p>    <p></p>
    <p>Foucault analyzes three epistemes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The episteme of the Renaissance, characterized by resemblance and similitude</li>
        <li>The episteme of the Classical era, characterized by representation and ordering, identity and difference, as categorization and taxonomy</li>
        <li>The episteme of the Modern era, the character of which is the subject of the book</li>
    </ol>
