    <h3>Hetrotopia</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>Heterotopia is a concept elaborated by philosopher Michel Foucault to describe certain cultural, institutional and discursive spaces that are somehow "other": disturbing, intense, incompatible, contradictory or transforming. Heterotopias are worlds within worlds, mirroring and yet upsetting what is outside. Foucault provides examples: ships, cemeteries, bars, brothels, prisons, gardens of antiquity, fairs, Muslim baths and many more.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>His first mention of the concept is in his preface to</p>
    <a href="the-order-of-things/index.html">The Order of Things,</a>
    <p>and refers to texts rather than socio-cultural spaces.</p>
